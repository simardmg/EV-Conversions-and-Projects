# EV Conversions and Projects

This repository documents electric vehicle (EV) conversion projects for cars and scooters, with practical guides, battery layouts, wiring diagrams, performance testing, and scripts used in real-world conversions.

---

## Highlights

- **Car Conversions:** Converted a Santro car to full electric, including DC-DC upgrade, 12V Li battery, solenoid and wiring modifications, and media system enhancements.
- **Scooter Conversions:** Converted 2 Vespas to electric, with detailed battery layouts, BMS settings, charging notes, and range logs.
- **Battery Analysis:** Comparison of LTO, LFP, and NMC chemistries including cost per kWh, cycle life, and real-world driving range.
- **Tools & Scripts:** Cell balancing scripts, data logging templates, and other utilities for EV maintenance and monitoring.
